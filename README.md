# **Crop Recommendation System (Team 2)**

Landless or marginal farmers lack the resources to either buy or lease more land or invest in farm infrastructure. In order to mitigate this agrarian crisis in the current status quo, there is a need for better recommendation systems to alleviate the crisis by helping the farmers to make an informed decision before starting the cultivation of crops.

To recommend optimum crops to be cultivated by farmers based on several parameters and help them make an informed decision before cultivation
The major parameters considered here are:
1. Soil Quality (N, P, K values respectively)
2. Humidity
3. Temperature
4. Rainfall

###  Download and Unzip Contents from GitHub Repo

Download and unzip contents from https://github.com/theshredbox/Team-2_Crop-Recommendation-System

### Generating the PKL file

The machine learning model used in this project will firstly have to be generated by successfully running the included Jupyter notebook [Crop_Recommendation_P-6.ipynb](https://github.com/theshredbox/Team-2_Crop-Recommendation-System/blob/main/src/tasks/Crop_Recommendation_P-6.ipynb). Upon successfully running all code cells, a pickle model for each ML model trained will be created that can be further used for deployment.
